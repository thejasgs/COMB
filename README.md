# COMB: A Hybrid Method for Cross-validated Feature Selection
**Feature Selex** is a Python 3 module that contains the official implementation of the COMB feature selection method for classification.

The methods in this module take two dataframes *X* and *Y*. *X* is contains column of features which may only contain *int64* datatypes. *Y* contains one column of labels. 

If you are feeling adventurous, feel free to take the package and tweak the parameters!

## Dependancies
- numpy
- pandas
- scikitlearn

You may install them using:

```python3 -m pip install --user numpy sklearn pandas```

## Usage
```python
import featureSelex
X = featureSelex.COMB(X,Y)
```

#### OR

```python 
from featureSelex import COMB
X = COMB(X,Y)
```
*Voila! **X** now only contains the columns of the selected features.*
